        <p>Scott is a Geologist and Mathematician by degree. As a teen in Baltimore City, Scott found a passion in minerals at his local rock shop; that passion led to his future career in the Oil and Gas Industry as a Geologist. Scott spent the first ~5 years after college fulfilling multiple jobs as a well site and office based Geologist/ Geo-Chemist. This career earned Scott a healthy income, but he knew how  long  the pay to wealth was when SAVING is the mode of transport. Scott continued to live a college lifestyle and save/invest everything with the  goal  of shortening that journey. After much deliberation and a few lessons learned Scott was committed to his investment strategy. Scott began leveraging his income to purchase multifamily residential properties. </p>
