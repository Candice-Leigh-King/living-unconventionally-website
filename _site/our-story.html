        Our Story
    </h2>
    <p class="col-12 padded"><p>We met when we were 19 and 27 years old at a country music festival in Southwest Colorado; Cassidy was on summer break from college &amp; visiting her dad in Grand Junction where Scott lived and worked as a semi-retired Geologist and young Landlord.</p><p>Cassidy attended the music festival alone because none of her friends could make it that year; Scott&rsquo;s friends were jamming in the VIP section while he was wandering through General Admission. Scott asked Cassidy to dance, and she offered him a ride home with her father, which he politely declined (but did snag her phone number in the process).</p><p>We texted daily as Cassidy embarked on her summer adventures back-and-forth to Grand Junction where she would visit Scott on the weekends. We were blessed with a pregnancy just 6 weeks after meeting each other, and we quickly adapted both of our lives to become a family and journey through life together.</p><p>Cassidy dropped out of the Adventure Education program and transferred schools to be closer to Scott while finishing out school as a Business major.</p><p>We had our first son, Atlas, during finals week of Cassidy&rsquo;s Junior year of college. When Atlas was 5 months old, Scott proposed to Cassidy on a trip to Austin, Texas. We conceived our second son, Isle, immediately after that and had him the summer after Cassidy graduated from college.</p><p>The rest is history!</p><p>Today we are based in Grand Junction, Colorado where we both work in real estate (Scott as an investor and Cassidy as a Real Estate Agent) and travel frequently throughout the Southwestern United States and Latin America.</p><p>We embrace an unconventional lifestyle through our approach to income and financial freedom, educating and raising our kids, and our approach to life in general. We prioritize growth, freedom, intentionality, and creative thinking.</p><p>We have been exploring life outside the box together for over 6 years now, and we are Living Unconventionally!</p></p>
