    We do not use any curriculum for our kids; we do enroll them in camps,
    clubs, and other kid-friendly activities where they are exposed to new
    situations and people. We encourage our boys to step out of their comfort
    zones, take risks, and to always make a new friend.

    We had our first son, Atlas, during finals week of Cassidy's Junior year of
    college. When Atlas was 5 months old, Scott proposed to Cassidy on a trip to
    Austin, Texas. We conceived our second son, Isle, immediately after that and
    had him the summer after Cassidy graduated from college. <br>The rest is
    history!
