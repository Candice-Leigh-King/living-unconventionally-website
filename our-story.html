        Scott is a Geologist and Mathematician by degree. As a teen in Baltimore
        City, Scott found a passion in minerals at his local rock shop; that
        passion led to his future career in the Oil and Gas Industry as a
        Geologist. Scott spent the first ~5 years after college fulfilling
        multiple jobs as a well site and office based Geologist/ Geo-Chemist.
        This career earned Scott a healthy income, but he knew how  long  the
        pay to wealth was when SAVING is the mode of transport. Scott continued
        to live a college lifestyle and save/invest everything with the  goal 
        of shortening that journey. After much deliberation and a few lessons
        learned Scott was committed to his investment strategy. Scott began
        leveraging his income to purchase multifamily residential properties.

    heading: Our Story
    textarea_html: >-
      <p>We met when we were 19 and 27 years old at a country music festival in
      Southwest Colorado; Cassidy was on summer break from college &amp;
      visiting her dad in Grand Junction where Scott lived and worked as a
      semi-retired Geologist and young Landlord.</p><p>Cassidy attended the
      music festival alone because none of her friends could make it that year;
      Scott&rsquo;s friends were jamming in the VIP section while he was
      wandering through General Admission. Scott asked Cassidy to dance, and she
      offered him a ride home with her father, which he politely declined (but
      did snag her phone number in the process).</p><p>We texted daily as
      Cassidy embarked on her summer adventures back-and-forth to Grand Junction
      where she would visit Scott on the weekends. We were blessed with a
      pregnancy just 6 weeks after meeting each other, and we quickly adapted
      both of our lives to become a family and journey through life
      together.</p><p>Cassidy dropped out of the Adventure Education program and
      transferred schools to be closer to Scott while finishing out school as a
      Business major.</p><p>We had our first son, Atlas, during finals week of
      Cassidy&rsquo;s Junior year of college. When Atlas was 5 months old, Scott
      proposed to Cassidy on a trip to Austin, Texas. We conceived our second
      son, Isle, immediately after that and had him the summer after Cassidy
      graduated from college.</p><p>The rest is history!</p><p>Today we are
      based in Grand Junction, Colorado where we both work in real estate (Scott
      as an investor and Cassidy as a Real Estate Agent) and travel frequently
      throughout the Southwestern United States and Latin America.</p><p>We
      embrace an unconventional lifestyle through our approach to income and
      financial freedom, educating and raising our kids, and our approach to
      life in general. We prioritize growth, freedom, intentionality, and
      creative thinking.</p><p>We have been exploring life outside the box
      together for over 6 years now, and we are Living Unconventionally!</p>
