        Scott is a Geologist and Mathematician by degree. As a teen in Baltimore
        City, Scott found a passion in minerals at his local rock shop; that
        passion led to his future career in the Oil and Gas Industry as a
        Geologist. Scott spent the first ~5 years after college fulfilling
        multiple jobs as a well site and office based Geologist/ Geo-Chemist.
        This career earned Scott a healthy income, but he knew how  long  the
        pay to wealth was when SAVING is the mode of transport. Scott continued
        to live a college lifestyle and save/invest everything with the  goal 
        of shortening that journey. After much deliberation and a few lessons
        learned Scott was committed to his investment strategy. Scott began
        leveraging his income to purchase multifamily residential properties.
