      textarea_html: Scott is a Geologist by degree, a real estate investor by trade, and the Papa of our adventure family. As a teen in Baltimore City, Scott found a passion in minerals at his local rock shop; that passion led to his future career in the Oil and Gas Industry as a Geologist. Scott spent the first ~5 years after college in the oil field, a career that earned Scott a healthy income; however, he knew how  long the path to wealth was when saving is the mode of transport. Scott continued to live a college lifestyle and save/invest everything with the goal of shortening that journey. Scott began leveraging his income to purchase multifamily residential properties; at the age of 23, Scott bought his first 4-Plex. Scott lived in one unit with roommates and rented the other 3 units while continuing to work in the oil field. With the income of work and the rent from the 4-plex, his vision was clear. It was obvious that creating leverage with income to purchase multi-family real estate was a very clear path to wealth.  At 33 years old in 2022, Scott had amassed over 130 residential units, 50% ownership in a 10,000 sq ft Real Estate Co-Worker Space, 50% ownership in a property management company, a wealth of knowledge, and just released his first book, The Millenial Map to Millions in Real Estate. He'll say that 4-plex was the best decision of his life.

      textarea_html: Cassidy is an adventurer at heart and exploring new places has always been her passion project. Cassidy had an amazing experience in college studying Adventure Education and International Business. Part of Cassidy's amazing experience was created by her unshakable determination to travel as far and as wide as she possibly could (and in a way that would make the most financial sense). Cassidy attended 3 different colleges in 4 years, including a semester at University of the Virgin Islands - Saint Croix. After making a 500 mile trek across Spain, birthing 2 beautiful babies, and receiving a college degree, Cassidy became a Real Estate Agent in order to help Scott with the contract side of his dealings. Cassidy now spends most of her time with our boys, Worldschooling and educating them through life experiences. Her working hours are primarily focused on content creation for Living Unconventionally, documenting all of our family's travels and adventures throughout the United States and around the world. She prides herself on inspiring others to step outside of the box and dream wildly and vividly. Cassidy is obsessed with audio books which allow her to grow her knowledge and understanding of health and longevity, investment strategies, communication, self-development, and parenting. She is an explorer who is committed to seeing as much of the world as possible with her time given here on this Earth.

      textarea_html: Atlas is our eldest son and is a joyous and strong young man with a real zest for fun and life! He was born before his parents' first anniversary, and he came out ready to adventure around the world! He is happy to do any physical activity and loves being outdoors; he consistently surprises us with his will to get things done the right way, no matter how many tries it takes. Atlas excels at making new friends in all of our travels, correcting his dad's Spanish accent, and making sure his little brother stays out of mischiefâ€¦ most of the time!

      textarea_html: Isle is our youngest and a little ray of sunshine. He is different from the rest of us with his bright blonde hair and forest-green eyes. Isle has an attention for detail and a deep compassion for all living creatures. Particularly, different types of bugs. He also finds treasures wherever we go. Isle loves to build with blocks or tiles, play in the water, and do anything his big brother is doing.

    heading: Our Story
    textarea_html: >-
      <p>We met when we were 19 and 27 years old at a country music festival in Southwest Colorado; Cassidy was on summer break from college & visiting her dad in Grand Junction where Scott lived and worked as a semi-retired Geologist and young Landlord.</p><p>Cassidy attended the music festival alone because none of her friends could make it that year; Scott's friends were jamming in the VIP section while he was wandering through General Admission. Scott asked Cassidy to dance, and she offered him a ride home with her father, which he politely declined (but did snag her phone number in the process). </p><p>We texted daily as Cassidy embarked on her summer adventures back-and-forth to Grand Junction where she would visit Scott on the weekends. We were blessed with a pregnancy just 6 weeks after meeting each other, and we quickly adapted both of our lives to become a family and journey through life together.</p><p>Cassidy dropped out of the Adventure Education program and transferred schools to be closer to Scott while finishing out school as a Business major. </p><p>We had our first son, Atlas, during finals week of Cassidy's Junior year of college. When Atlas was 5 months old, Scott proposed to Cassidy on a trip to Austin, Texas. We conceived our second son, Isle,  immediately after that and had him the summer after Cassidy graduated from college.</p><p>The rest is history!</p><p>Today we are based in Grand Junction, Colorado where we both work in real estate (Scott as an investor and Cassidy as a Real Estate Agent) and travel frequently throughout the Southwestern United States and Latin America.</p><p>We embrace an unconventional lifestyle through our approach to income and financial freedom, educating and raising our kids, and our approach to life in general. We prioritize growth, freedom, intentionality, and creative thinking. </p><p>We have been exploring life outside the box together for over 6 years now, and we are Living Unconventionally!</p>
