<!-- What in the world is world schooling? 
  
  
     Worldschooling is an experience-based approach to education that includes travel, languages, and world cultures to teach kids, while remaining child-led in the approach (as opposed to teacher-led or parent-led). 
     
     
     Although we try not to push any specific topic at our kids, we do try to take advantage of learning opportunities and experiences that are all around us, both at home and on the road. 
     
     
     We do not use any curriculum for our kids; we do enroll them in camps, clubs, and other kid-friendly activities where they are exposed to new situations and people. We encourage our boys to step out of their comfort zones, take risks, and to always make a new friend.   -->
