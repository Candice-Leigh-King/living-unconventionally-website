        <p><strong>What in the world is world
        schooling?</strong></p><p>Worldschooling is an experience-based approach to education that includes travel, languages, and world cultures to teach kids, while remaining child-led in the approach (as opposed to teacher-led or parent-led).</p><p>Although we try not to push any specific topic at our kids, we do try to take advantage of learning opportunities and experiences that are all around us, both at home and on the road.</p><p>We do not use any curriculum for our kids; we do enroll them in camps, clubs, and other kid-friendly activities where they are exposed to new situations and people. We encourage our boys to step out of their comfort zones, take risks, and to always make a new friend.</p><p>We made the decision when our boys were born to prioritize experiences over things and to not let anyone else dictate what their childhood should look like. Although our boys are young and about school-aged, we don't have any plans to enroll them in a traditional school setting any time soon. </p>

        <p><strong>Instead, we will focus on travel, community, and healthy living</strong> in hopes that it prepares our boys in the best way possible for the life they have ahead of them.</p><p>Crucial parts of our worldschooling education include: our national parks pass, our frequent adventures to Latin America where we vividly engage our Spanish skills, our local science-center, any water (pools, lakes, beaches, rivers),  and our willingness to participate in whatever new experience or opportunity comes our way.</p><p>If you have any questions about
