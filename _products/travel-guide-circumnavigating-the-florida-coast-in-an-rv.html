  title: Circumnavigating the Florida Coast in an RV
  description: >-
    When the pandemic hit and we couldn't fly, we bought an RV to continue our

    Florida coast. From beaches and boat rides to animal encounters, this is the
    perfect 60 day itinerary for families with young kids who want to SEE IT ALL
    in the Sunshine State.
