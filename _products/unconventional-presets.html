  title: Unconventional Presets
  description: >-
    These photo presets were created for easy editing in the Mobile Lightroom
    App (free). Built with locations in mind such as the Desert Southwest,
    Central America, and the Rocky Mountains, these photo presets will give your
    adventure photos the little boost they need! All you have to do is upload
    your photo, select which filter you want to use, and tap the button! It
    really is that easy to edit your photos. Each of these presets was created
    from an adventure of my own; you'll see that they are named after where
    they've been inspired from.
