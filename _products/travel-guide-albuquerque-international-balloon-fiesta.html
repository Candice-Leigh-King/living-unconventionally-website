  title: Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta
  description: >-
    Every year over 700 hot air balloons take to the sky at the Albuquerque
    International Balloon Fiesta. This is an incredible bucket list experience
    for all ages, but it is super kid-friendly and a great experience for
    families. Albuquerque is a lively, artsy, and cultural city with lots to
    see, and the magic of the hot air balloons only ads to the magic of this
    Southwestern desert town.
