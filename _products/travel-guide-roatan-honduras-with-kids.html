  title: Roatán, Honduras with Kids
  description: >-
    This tiny island is considered to be the dive capital of the Caribbean, home
    to the largest underwater reef in the Western Hemisphere (and second largest
    in the world)! Roatán is in the Bay Islands of Honduras, and it's a great
    option for families because the reef is super close to the shore, allowing
    even small children to snorkel with plenty of diverse marine life easily.
