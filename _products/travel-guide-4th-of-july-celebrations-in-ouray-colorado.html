  title: 4th of July Celebrations in Ouray, Colorado
  description: Have you ever wondered where the most magical 4th of July celebrations in the country are? Look no further than this tiny, mountain paradise in Southwest Colorado! Ouray offers festivities all day long from an epic squirt-gun parade to kids' games in the parks, and a magical firework show that echos through the box canyon. I recommend this Classic American travel experience to all families to try at least once!
