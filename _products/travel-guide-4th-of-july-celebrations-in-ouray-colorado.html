  description: >-
    Have you ever wondered where the most magical 4th of July celebrations in
    the country are? Look no further than this tiny, mountain paradise in
    Southwest Colorado! Ouray offers festivities all day long from an epic
    squirt-gun parade to kids' games in the parks, and a magical firework show
    that echos through the box canyon. I recommend this Classic American travel
    experience to all families to try at least once!
