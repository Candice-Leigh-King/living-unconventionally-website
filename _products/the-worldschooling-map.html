    For those who don't know what a WorldSchooling Hub is:


    Essentially, a worldschooling hub is a physical location where families can
    come together to learn, explore and connect with other like-minded families.
    These hubs are located in different parts of the world, and they provide a
    unique opportunity for families to immerse themselves in different cultures,
    languages, and ways of life.


    These worldschooling communities offer families the opportunity to meet
    other like-minded folks while developing a sense of community while on the
    road. For digital nomad families or families who work remotely, this is an
    awesome alternative or supplement to your homeschool or online school
    routine.
